## About me

I am at the start of my education now, but I find web-development is very exciting. Getting to the bottom of the problem, learning tools, cooperating with other people, and finally resolving it - feels really satisfying for me.

## Skills

- JavaScript (basics)
- HTML5, CSS3
- VSCode
- Git, GitHub

## Code example

Kata [Bit Counting](<https://www.codewars.com/kata/526571aae218b8ee490006f4>) from Codewars
*Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.*

```JavaScript
var countBits = function(number) {
  let bitInBin = 0;
  let result = 0;
  
  while (number >= 1) {
    bitInBin = number % 2;
    if (bitInBin + '' === '1') result +=1;
    number = (number - bitInBin) / 2;  
  }
  return result;  
};
```
